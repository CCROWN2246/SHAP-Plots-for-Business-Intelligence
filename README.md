# SHAP-Plots-for-Business-Intelligence
Used R to deploy SMOTE (synthetic minority oversampling technique) and XGBoost and then turned the data into SHAP plots that we used to give business recommendations to a business team. SHAP plots show interaction between features, feature importance and help add interpretability to Machine Learning models. In a case competition, we were tasked to provide actionable business insights to a high-end grocery store from recent  marketing data. Neither the model alone nor the feature coefficients would mean anything to the executive team, so we created these useful Shapley Additive Explanations to show trends and then distilled the charts into 1-2 sentence deliverables that we could then further explain to the data team.
